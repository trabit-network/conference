<p itemprop="description">
  The
  <a href="https://trabit.eu/">Translational Brain Imaging Training Network</a>
  (TRABIT) is an EU-funded consortium focused on developing new computational
  methods to analyze the "wild" type of imaging data arising in the standard
  clinical treatment of brain disorders.
</p>
<p>
  To mark the nearing end of the project, we are organizing a virtual conference
  with leading keynote speakers and round table discussions on the four
  scientific work packages of TRABIT:
</p>
<p>
  <span>&#8226;</span> Fetal brain disorders (with Dr. Ellen Grant, Children's
  Hospital Boston), Tue Sep 7th
</p>
<p>
  <span>&#8226;</span> Brain tumors (with Dr. Ron Kikinis, Harvard Medical
  School, and Dr. Christos Davatzikos, University of Pennsylvania), Wed Sep 8th
</p>
<p>
  <span>&#8226;</span> Multiple Sclerosis (with Dr. Daniel Reich, National
  Institutes of Health), Thu Sep 9th
</p>
<p>

  University of Munich), Fri Sep 10th
</p>
<p>
  You are cordially invited to attend -- the detailed schedule is below.

    </h3>
    <p class="speakers-bio">PD. Dr. Kirschke conducts research in quantitative neuro-oncologic and musculoskeletal imaging. Starting in 2001 with research on high resolution bone imaging, he is now head of the quantitative imaging research group at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology at TUM. He develops imaging protocols and algorithms to analyze recurrence and tumor growth in glioma patients as well as to predict osteoporotic fractures and treatment success in back pain patients. PD Dr. Kirschke studied medicine in Regensburg and Munich, where he finished his thesis in 2004. He subsequently moved to San Francisco where he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the musculoskeletal quantitative imaging group at UCSF. In 2006 he started his training in radiology at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the Technical University Munich, Germany. He was board-certified in 2012 and works as senior consultant at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology since 2013.</p>

    </h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-name">
       
    </h3>
    <p class="speakers-bio">Dr. Reich studied math and physics at Yale and earned his MD from Cornell and his PhD in neurophysiology from The Rockefeller University, where he studied how nerve cells in the visual system encode what we see. His further training includes a fellowship in diagnostic neuroradiology and residencies in radiology and neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Daniel Reich is Senior Investigator at NIH/NINDS, where he directs the Translational Neuroradiology Section and leads clinical studies focusing mainly on multiple sclerosis (MS). He is also an attending neuroradiologist at the NIH Clinical Center and an Adjunct Professor of Radiology, Neurology, and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Research in Dr. Reich’s lab develops advanced MRI techniques to understand MS and adapts those techniques for clinical trials and patient care. The lab harnesses noninvasive imaging modalities to dissect biological mechanisms of tissue damage, both by performing longitudinal studies on time scales relevant for disease processes and by examining radiological-pathological correlations in autopsy tissue and animal models. Dr. Reich has authored more than 240 peer-reviewed publications, presented more than 150 invited lectures across the world, and has been principal or associate investigator of more than 50 clinical protocols. In 2018, Dr. Reich’s lab reported that human and nonhuman primates have a lymphatic system in the membranes covering the brain and showed how that system can be imaged noninvasively with MRI.</p>

This technology is being used to merge image-derived, subject-specific information with the patient&#39;s anatomy. Such merged information allows the physicians to see what they could not otherwise and to navigate tools and instruments to achieve better results. These technologies are not available in most low and middle income countries (LMIC) due to the costs of equipment and consumables, and the need for specialized training to use the technology. Recent developments have significantly lowered the cost of navigation equipment, including ultrasound imaging scanners, motion tracking systems and navigation software, but end-to-end solutions targeting specific procedures have yet to be developed. To be practical, such solutions need to be compliant with relevant laws and adjusted to boundary conditions in LMICs. Two examples will be discussed in greater detail in order to demonstrate the challenges and possible solutions.</p>

                <p id="abstract_1" class="hideabs abstract schedule-description">In the 1990s, following the discovery that it could noninvasively identify white matter lesions and track their development, MRI revolutionized the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and the search for disease-modifying treatments. Four generations of MRI-based diagnostic rules, known as the McDonald Criteria, have ensued, but there remains a substantial problem of misdiagnosis and over/undertreatment. To improve diagnostic accuracy and better capture the radiological correlates of slowly worsening disability known as progression, and to ensure that imaging measures are optimally applied to individuals (rather than populations), at least 5 challenges need to be overcome: (1) distinguishing MS lesions from nonspecific white matter lesions; (2) finding new MS lesions in the setting of high lesion burden; (3) differentiating chronic lesion types and tracking their evolution over time; (4) identifying leptomeningeal inflammation and subpial cortical lesions; and (5) assessing brain atrophy in the clinical setting. In this talk, I will give a high-level overview and present specific examples to illustrate the approach our lab has taken to addressing these issues and applying them in the clinic.</p>
