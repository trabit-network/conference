<p itemprop="description">The conference is organized by the "Translational Brain Imaging Training Network" (TRABIT).</p>

<p>The TRABIT is an interdisciplinary and intersectoral joint effort of computational scientists,
    clinicians, and the industry in the field of neuroimaging. Its aim is to train a new generation
    of innovative and entrepreneurial researchers to bring quantitative image computing methods into
    the clinic, enabling improved healthcare delivery to patients with brain disease.</p>

    </h3>
    <p class="speakers-bio">PD. Dr. Kirschke conducts research in quantitative neuro-oncologic and musculoskeletal imaging. Starting in 2001 with research on high resolution bone imaging, he is now head of the quantitative imaging research group at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology at TUM. He develops imaging protocols and algorithms to analyze recurrence and tumor growth in glioma patients as well as to predict osteoporotic fractures and treatment success in back pain patients. PD Dr. Kirschke studied medicine in Regensburg and Munich, where he finished his thesis in 2004. He subsequently moved to San Francisco where he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the musculoskeletal quantitative imaging group at UCSF. In 2006 he started his training in radiology at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology of the Technical University Munich, Germany. He was board-certified in 2012 and works as senior consultant at the Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology since 2013.</p>

    </h3>

    <h3 class="speakers-name">
      
    </h3>
    <p class="speakers-bio">Dr. Reich studied math and physics at Yale and earned his MD from Cornell and his PhD in neurophysiology from The Rockefeller University, where he studied how nerve cells in the visual system encode what we see. His further training includes a fellowship in diagnostic neuroradiology and residencies in radiology and neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Daniel Reich is Senior Investigator at NIH/NINDS, where he directs the Translational Neuroradiology Section and leads clinical studies focusing mainly on multiple sclerosis (MS). He is also an attending neuroradiologist at the NIH Clinical Center and an Adjunct Professor of Radiology, Neurology, and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Research in Dr. Reich’s lab develops advanced MRI techniques to understand MS and adapts those techniques for clinical trials and patient care. The lab harnesses noninvasive imaging modalities to dissect biological mechanisms of tissue damage, both by performing longitudinal studies on time scales relevant for disease processes and by examining radiological-pathological correlations in autopsy tissue and animal models. Dr. Reich has authored more than 240 peer-reviewed publications, presented more than 150 invited lectures across the world, and has been principal or associate investigator of more than 50 clinical protocols. In 2018, Dr. Reich’s lab reported that human and nonhuman primates have a lymphatic system in the membranes covering the brain and showed how that system can be imaged noninvasively with MRI.</p>

    <p class="speakers-bio">Dr. Grant holds a Master of Science degree in physics and an MD from the University of Toronto. She did her radiology residency at Vancouver General Hospital in British Columbia, Canada, and her fellowship in adult and pediatric neuroradiology at the University of California, San Francisco. She is now a Professor of Radiology and Pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Grant headed the Division of Pediatric Radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital for five years before moving to Children&#39;s Hospital Boston to become the founding director of the Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center and the first incumbent of Children&#39;s Hospital Boston Chair in Neonatology. At Children&#39;s she holds appointments in the Division of Newborn Medicine and the Department of Radiology. Dr. Grant is a co-author of two popular textbooks for clinical neuroradiology and has won a number of awards for her research efforts as well as recognition for her clinical excellence.</p>
